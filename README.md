# Master-thesis-AI
Repo for code used in the workings of the master thesis

###most important scripts

compare diffence between two sensors boxplot
compare difference between sensor and theoretical value
plot both sensors against oneanother
plot sensor and theoretical value

these four algorithms look into the original data and see what differences there are between both sensors and between a sensor and the theorethical value


plot dough temp by timestamp

This algorithm plots 1 timeseries devided in all 4 parts of the process 

other python scripts are for testing or were working prototypes
